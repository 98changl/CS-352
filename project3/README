1. Functionality Implementation:

(1) Set up the IP addresses of all interfaces.
For each host and the router, we added the appropriate ip address to each device in the hosts 
by attaching the designated IP to the desired device with "ip addr add".

(2) Set up the default routes for the hosts.
The given IP address for each host device had their default routes set up 
by routing the newly set up addresses to the hosts' default gateway.
Ex. default via IP ADDR

(3) Set up the routes on the router.
The routes for the router was added by attaching the IP addresses of the hosts to the IP address of their respective devices in r1.
Ex. 10.0.0.2 was routed to 10.0.0.1

This also has no issues because the routed IP addesses for the hosts were already set to their default
so the address will always be in use by the hosts.

(4) Test your network.
To test our network, we used a tests.txt file with a list of ping and trace route commands.

2. Currently known issues with code:
There are no known issues with code.

3. Problems we encountered:
The biggest problem we encountered was setting up the virtual machine for mininet, 
specifically when it came to transfering the AS352.py file into the mininet. 
We tried the Scp command for copying over files as instructed but still encountered a file not found error. 
This lead us to let to significant delays in building the project.

4. What did we learn?
The default route is used to set up a defualt IP address to connect to if no other IP address is used.
As such, the inputted IP addresses for our hosts will always be used as there are no other addresses set up for the hosts.

Once a single route between a host and r1 was made,
the router automatically connects it to every other device in the router.
Ex. Routing h1-eth0 connects it to r1-eth1, r1-eth2, r1-eth3, and r1-eth4 so long as the devices on r1 were previously set up.

This meant that there was no need to manually IP route devices on the same host.
Ex. IP route r1-eth1 to r1-eth2 is redundant because they're from the same host.
