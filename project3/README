1. Functionality Implementation:

(1) Set up the IP addresses of all interfaces.
For each host and the router, we added the appropriate ip address to each device in the hosts.
This is done by attaching the designated IP 

(2) Set up the default routes for the hosts.
The given IP address for each host was added to the default gateway.

(3) Set up the routes on the router.
The routes for the router was added by attaching the IP addresses of the hosts to the IP address of their respective devices in r1.

2. Currently known issues with code:
There are no known issues with code.

3. Problems we encountered:
The biggest problem we encountered was setting up the virtual machine for mininet, 
specifically when it came to transfering the AS352.py file into the mininet.

4. What did we learn?
Setting up routes for the router doesn't have to go both ways.
Ex. IP 

Once a single route between a host and r1 was made,
the router automatically connects it to every other device in the router.
Ex. Routing h1-eth0 connects it to r1-eth1, r1-eth2, r1-eth3, and r1-eth4 so long as the devices on r1 were previously set up.

This meant that there was no need to manually IP route devices on the same host.
Ex. IP route r1-eth1 to r1-eth2 is redundant because they're from the same host.
