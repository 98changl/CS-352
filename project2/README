1. How we implemented ts tracking in ls
The ls tracks which ts responded by making recv() calls one server at a time.
It sends the hostname to all ts servers, and waits for each server to send a reply.
The ls wait for one ts to either send a reply or wait the timeout is reached.
Once one of the two above conditions have been met, the ls make a recv() call to the second ts.

2. Currently known issues with code:
The only known issues with the code is detecting socket closures for our ts server.

3. Problems we encountered: 
One problem we encountered was with our search function. This issue was solved after making two changes.
The first change was our data structure. Rather than a complex structure with individual strings for each value, 
we instead opted for a list containing all the inputs from file.
The second change was format where the '\n' was being read into the list, causing correct comparisons to be missed.

4. What did we learn?
We learned that implementing a load balancing DNS server is beneficial to the network due to the fact that it reduces server load. 
Having a network where we are minimizing server load can help us expand the network.
