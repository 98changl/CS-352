1. How we implemented ts tracking in ls
The ls does not track which ts it is recieving data from. 
Instead, it sends the hostname to all ts servers, and waits for each server to send a reply.
The ls has a recv() call to the first ts, and wait for either a reply or until the timeout is reached.
Once one of the two above conditions have been met, the server has a recv() call to the second ts.


2. Currently known issues with code:
The only known issues with the code is detecting socket closures for our ts server.

3. Problems we encountered: 
One problem we encountered was with our search function. But we were able to solve that issue later on throughout the debugging process.

4. What did we learn?
We learned that implementing a load balancing DNS server is beneficial to the network due to the fact that it reduces server load. 
Having a network where we are minimizing server load can help us expand the network.
