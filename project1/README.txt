1. How we implemented recurive client
For the client, we first created a soeckt connection to the rs DNS server.
While sending DNS queries to the server, if the rs DNS replies with a failure, then the client creates a socket connection to the ts DNS server.

2. Currently known issues with code
No official testing has been performed.
How to connect to server from different computer?

3. Problems we encountered

4. What did we learn?
A recursive DNS client behaves similarly to an iterative DNS service where the client behaves like a root DNS server.
The client handles interactions between DNS servers and processes server replies as well.
